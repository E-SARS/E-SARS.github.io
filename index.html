        <h2 class="title">Description and Motivation</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
        This workshop focuses on advancing safe and quality-assured embodied robotic systems. Embodied systems—including autonomous robots, self-driving vehicles, 
        robotic arms, and humanoid robots—are increasingly deployed in safety-critical real-world scenarios. Ensuring their trustworthiness—encompassing safety, reliability, 
        and predictable behavior—remains a pressing challenge. Despite notable progress in perception, reasoning, and control, many AI-based robotic systems still operate as “black boxes,”
        often exhibiting unpredictable behaviors. Failures can emerge from complex sensorimotor interactions, adversarial inputs, or novel environments, leading to safety incidents and diminished user trust.
        Recent studies have shown that the intricate interplay among sensors, actuators, and AI components exposes embodied
         agents to a wide range of vulnerabilities, including sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and planning failures, which may result in unauthorized actions or physical harm. These risks underscore the 
         urgent need for robust safety measures throughout system deployment. Rigorous testing and validation are essential to identify and mitigate such failure modes before real-world use. In high-stakes domains 
         like autonomous driving, testing across diverse and complex scenarios is not only critical for verifying safety but also for earning public trust. Without confidence in their safety and reliability,
          the widespread adoption of embodied robotic systems will remain limited and potentially hazardous.

        By addressing these questions, this workshop aims to define a research agenda for safe and quality-assured embodied robotic systems. Achieving trustworthiness in these systems demands 
        a cross-disciplinary effort—integrating advances in machine learning, computer vision, planning, control, and formal methods—to enhance robustness and dependability. 
        To this end, this workshop will foster dialogue across diverse research communities: from ML researchers developing new algorithms to roboticists engineering physical 
        systems to verification experts designing assurance tools. Ultimately, we envision a future where interactive autonomous systems can be deployed at scale with confidence—supported by rigorous testing,
         verification, and validation that provide clear, quantifiable evidence of their trustworthiness to developers, users, and regulators.

                        <b>Abstract:</b> Autonomous driving systems (ADS) require extensive testing to ensure safety, reliability, and robustness across a wide spectrum of operational conditions. This talk introduces the state of the art in testing and evaluation of ADS, with a particular focus on simulation-based techniques and the challenges of transferring results from simulation to real-world environments. We discuss approaches for scenario generation and performance assessment, as well as current limitations in realism, sensor modeling, and non-deterministic behavior. Finally, the talk explores emerging research directions, such as sim2real consistency analysis, uncertainty quantification, and AI-driven test generation.

                      <div>
                        <b>Abstract:</b> For the development and deployment of Driving Automation Systems, manufacturers use scenarios to decompose the complex world into smaller pieces. Traditionally, scenarios focus on verification and validation processes. This talk introduces the Scenario as Specification approach, which connects requirements to scenario-based descriptions of target behavior. By combining target behavior with environmental context, scenarios become a foundation for safety engineering and verification and validation. Practical examples illustrate the key concepts and the motivation behind this approach.

                        <b>Abstract:</b> Autonomous driving systems operate in complex, unpredictable environments where accuracy alone is insufficient. Safe deployment requires robustness, efficiency, fault tolerance, and systematic testing. This talk discusses how software engineering perspectives help bridge the gap between ML model performance and real-world dependable autonomy. Dr. Yang introduces recent work on robustness frameworks for ADS perception, stress-testing perceptual modules, and detecting high-latency behaviors. These findings highlight the importance of engineering-driven analysis in building safer and more reliable autonomous systems.
